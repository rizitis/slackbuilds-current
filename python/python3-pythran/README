Pythran is an ahead of time compiler for a subset of the Python
language, with a focus on scientific computing. It takes a Python
module annotated with a few interface descriptions and turns it into a
native Python module with the same interface, but (hopefully) faster.

It is meant to efficiently compile scientific programs, and takes
advantage of multi-cores and SIMD instruction units.

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions than 0.15.0 due to breaking
academic/python3-scipy, which is stuck at that version due to the
version of Cython in Slackware 15.0.
