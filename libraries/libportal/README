libportal provides GIO-style async APIs for most Flatpak portals.

To build the API docs the optional dependency gi-docgen is required.
qt6 is another optional dependency.

NOTE:
0.8.1 it's the last version compatible iwht Slackware 15.0, as newer
ones will need a newer glib2 than this platform provides.
