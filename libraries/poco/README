Modern, powerful open source C++ class libraries and frameworks for
building network- and internet-based applications that run on desktop,
server, mobile and embedded systems.

PostgreSQL (on Sbo) and libiodbc (part of Slackware) or UnixODBC
(on SBo) are optional dependencies that will be automatically picked
up during configuration. 

By default, the build will use the internal libs for sqlite, zlib,
pcre2, expat, etc.  To use the Slackware versions:

BUNDLE=no ./poco.SlackBuild

This will disable any functionality not already included with or
added to Slackware.
