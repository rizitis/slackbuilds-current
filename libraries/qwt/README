Qwt is an extension to the Qt GUI library from Troll Tech AS.  The Qwt
library contains widgets and components which are primarily useful
for technical and scientifical purposes. It includes a 2-D plotting
widget, different kinds of sliders, and much more.

Optional dependency: qt4. If installed, the package will include qt4
support. Since the default SBo build of qt4 does not include support
for designer, no qwt designer plugin is installed for qt4.

If you're interested in developing software that uses qwt, you might
want to build this with EXAMPLES=yes in the environment. This will
compile the example and playground programs and install them in the
doc dir.

Some users have experienced problems when Playground component is
enabled, so is now turned off by default. It may be reenabled by
setting the environment variable
	PLAYGROUND=yes

Some users have experienced problems when Tests component is
enabled, so is now turned off by default. It may be reenabled by
setting the environment variable
	TESTS=yes
