haskell-http (client-side web programming in Haskell)

The HTTP package supports client-side web programming in Haskell. It
lets you set up HTTP connections, transmitting requests and processing
the responses coming back, all from within the comforts of Haskell.
It's dependent on the network package to operate, but other than that,
the implementation is all written in Haskell.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
