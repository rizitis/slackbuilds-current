The Fraunhofer Versatile Video Encoder (VVenC) is an
H.266/VVC encoder. Command line options can be seen
by running the following:

 vvencapp --help
 vvencFFapp --help

Two issues with the 32bit build currently exist:

 1. VVenC does not currently build on 32bit Linux
    although a fix for this is in progress upstream;
    see Issue 242 on the VVenC github site.
 2. When failure to build is addressed it is unlikely
    that the memory limits of 32bit processors will allow
    effective encoding.

Note that playback of H.266/VVC files is also currently a
little challenging under Linux, although 3rd party patches
for FFmpeg exist.
