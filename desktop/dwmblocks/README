dwmblocks is a modular status bar for dwm written in C.

The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.

If a blocks.h is found in the SlackBuild directory it will be copied to
the source directory and used in the build, allowing easy customisation.

This build of dwmblocks (written by torrinfail) only contains basic text
support. A rewrite of dwmblocks by ashish-yadav11 with additional
features (clickability, cursor hinting and color) is available at:
