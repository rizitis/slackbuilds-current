LeftWM is a tiling window manager written in Rust that aims to be stable
and performant. LeftWM is designed to do one thing and to do that one
thing well: be a window manager. LeftWM follows the following mantra:
LeftWM is not a compositor.
LeftWM is not a lock screen.
LeftWM is not a bar.
To build this you need at least Rust version 1.59, use 
extra/rust-for-mozilla version 1.60 or higher.
