amiwm (Amiga lookalike X window manager)

amiwm is an X window manager that tries to make your display look and
feel like an Amiga Workbench screen. It is fully functional and can do
all the usual window manager stuff, like moving and resizing windows.

The original website is https://www.lysator.liu.se/~marcus/amiwm.html
but what's packaged here is a fork from github which has been
updated (in 2017) to build on modern compilers.

Due to license restrictions, you may not redistribute the binary
package this script builds.
