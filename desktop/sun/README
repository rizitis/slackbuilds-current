SUN (Slackware Update Notifier) is a tray notification applet
and daemon for informing about package updates in Slackware.
It also serves as a CLI tool for monitoring upgraded packages.

SUN works by default with slackpkg, as well as with other tools
like slpkg. You can probably use SUN with other Slackware-based
Linux distributions as well.

Edit the configuration file at /etc/sun/sun.conf and change the
HTTP mirror to one in your country.

Note: FTP mirrors are not supported.
