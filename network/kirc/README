kirc (tiny IRC client)

kirc is "KISS for IRC", a tiny IRC client written in POSIX C99.

Note: when using the -c option, a single # is prepended to the
channel. If you're using Libera and a channel name with ##, you'll
want to use -c '#channel' (with quotes, to prevent the shell from
interpreting the # as a comment).
