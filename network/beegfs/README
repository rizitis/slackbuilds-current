BeeGFS aka. beegfs is a parallel filesystem that runs on
vanilla Linux kernel.
Officially supported filesystems for underlying local storage are
ext4, xfs, and zfs.

BeeGFS can be accessed through TCP and RDMA links.

Each file on beegfs can be stored in a specific storage pool.
Hard links and data/metadata mirroring are supported.

Authorization is required for production use of features such as
mirroring, quota enforcement (not quota tracking), and
more than one storage pools, etc.
Refer to the file "LICENSE.txt" for details.

Set BEEGFS_CTL_SUID to YES to install the beegfs-ctl program
setUID to root:

    env BEEGFS_CTL_SETUID=YES ./beegfs.SlackBuild

openzfs is an optional run-time dependency.

Note: The client driver is kernel-dependent, so a re-compile
of this package is necessary for client nodes after a kernel-update.
