The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software
development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and
provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

NOTE: awscli is needed to perform authentication with AWS services
but not needed as build requirement.

This script only package CDK CLI, while CDK Construct Library
will continue to use the old versioning scheme
