  The oneAPI Video Processing Library (oneVPL) is a programming
interface for video decoding, encoding, and processing to build
portable media pipelines on CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators.

  It provides device discovery and selection in media centric and
video analytics workloads and API primitives for zero-copy buffer
sharing. oneVPL is backwards and cross-architecture compatible to
ensure optimal execution on current and next generation hardware
without source code changes.

  To use oneVPL for video processing you need to install at least
one implementation. Here is a list of current implementations.
  - oneVPL-cpu for use on CPU
  - oneVPL-intel-gpu for use on Intel Xe graphics and newer
  - Media SDK for use on legacy Intel graphics


  If you want to enable Python binding set the environment
variable: PYTHON=yes. This requires pybind11
