opencomal (interpreter for Comal programming language)

OpenComal is a portable and free implementation of the Comal programming
language written by Jos Visser. Currently supported platforms are Unix,
MsDos and Win32. Comal is a crossover between Basic and Pascal, with
the best features of both and none of the drawbacks of either.
