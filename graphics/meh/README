meh (image viewer for X)

meh is a small, simple, super fast image viewer using raw XLib.
It is similar to feh, but faster and simpler.

meh can use ImageMagick's convert to view almost 200 file formats,
though it is slower for these formats (note: this actually *works* as
of 0.3-3). Built in formats are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, and netpbm.

Animations (e.g. GIF, MNG) are not supported. Only the first frame
will be displayed.

Features:

  * Fast
  * Tiny
  * Fast JPEG, PNG, GIF and BMP support
  * Fast netpbm support (.ppm, .pgm, .pbm, .pnm)
  * ImageMagick support by calling convert
         * All ImageMagick formats (almost 200)
         * This allows limited support for PDFs and SVGs
  * Scales images to window size
  * Preserves aspect ratio (either via EWMH hints or padding the window)
  * XSHM Support
  * Minimal dependencies (Xlib, libjpeg, libpng, giflib)
