doomretro (Doom source port)

DOOM Retro is the classic, refined DOOM source port. It represents
what DOOM should be today, in all its dark, gritty, unapologetically
pixellated glory. DOOM Retro's source code is forked from Chocolate
DOOM, with enhancements from other DOOM source ports, as well as many
orignal ideas. DOOM Retro is deliberately minimalist by design, and
does a few things differently when compared with other source ports.

The game looks in /usr/share/games/doom (and a few other places) for
game data. To play Shareware Doom, install doom_shareware_data. To
play Doom 2 or the full version of Doom, copy doom2.wad or doom.wad
from the game CD or install directory to /usr/share/games/doom.

Settings are stored in $HOME/.config/doomretro. After starting Doom
Retro for the first time, you will find an editable doomretro.cfg
there.

NOTE: In Slackware 15.0, MIDI music playback in doomretro is broken.
The game will segfault the first time the music changes (when starting
a game, or when completing a level if -warp is used). To avoid this,
you must run "doomretro -nomusic" if starting from the command
line. If you're using a desktop launcher, the .desktop file already
includes the -nomusic argument. The issue is with Slackware's SDL2 and
fluidsynth packages, which can't be fixed by this SlackBuild. Sorry.
