The Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy
environment, where players can build an army of different kinds of
fighters from races such as elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, and more.
Gameplay occurs on a hexgrid with several challenging single-player
campaigns and different kinds of multi-player matches.

If you want to compile the wesnothd server and campaign server you can
run the script as follows:

  SERVER=yes ./wesnoth.SlackBuild

Please note that the server UID and GID are not required at compile
time but will be required at runtime under the UID/GID specified in
the buildscript. You can create the user and group for the wesnoth
server as follows:

  groupadd -g 229 wesnoth
  useradd -u 229 -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -g wesnoth wesnoth

The script will now check if MAKEFLAGS environment variable is set
and pass that value to the wesnoth scons build system. To change the
defaults, do something like

  # Set how many cores to use for the build
  export MAKEFLAGS="-j6" ; ./wesnoth.SlackBuild

  # Force use of the wesnoth defaults ( -j1 )
  unset MAKEFLAGS ; ./wesnoth.SlackBuild
