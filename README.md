**This is a weekly fork, following [ponce SlackBuilds](https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds) for Slackware-current.**
<ul>
  <li>Scripts here are modified for my personal!
  <li> Some scripts are patched for my personal use!
  <li> Sometimes might included files here that are removed from ponce or SBo or never existed there, also for my personal use!
  <li> Generaly speaking, there is no reason for you to use this repo and SlackBuilds...exept if you use [Captain-Slack](https://github.com/rizitis/captain-slack)
  - Then you can use it because all SlackBuilds here copy the slack-required file in `/usr/doc/$PRGNAM-$VERSION/` folder.This way I can have for every installed package also its dependencies in a txt file as information. 
  </ul>

 **If you use SlackBuilds from here, you use it at your own risk 100%.**<br>
