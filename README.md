# slackbuilds2dep

This is a fork of * [ponce](https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds) ponce slackbulds repo for Slackware-current.




We can style words: *Italic*, **Bold** and `code span`.

## DIFF repo-ponce repo-here

**DIFFS**
*Slackbuild folders and script here are edided to include command and files for*:
* slack-required
- package.dep
+ dependees-on
Also a SLACKBUILDS.TXT included.

### WHY?

*Three reasons for me*.
1. test my * [sqf2dep](https://github.com/rizitis/sqf2dep)script if working
2. since its working, now more package managers can have access to "ponce" slackbuild repo for Slackware current.
3. Some Slackware based distros also can have access or even better create their own ponce fork and maintain it...

#### TODO

NOTHING EVERYTHING IS PERFECT :D
