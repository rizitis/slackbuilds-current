**This is a weekly fork, following [ponce SlackBuilds](https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds) for Slackware-current.**
<ul>
  <li>Scripts here are modified for my personal use!
  <li> Some scripts are pathed for my personal use!
  <li> Sometimes might included files here that are removed from ponce or SBo or never existed there, also for my personal use!
  <li> Generaly speaking, there is no reason for you to use this SlackBuilds... 
  </ul>

 **If you use SlackBuilds from here, you use it at your own risk 100%.**<br>
