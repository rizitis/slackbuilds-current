Kurinto is a large collection of free fonts that include most of the
characters in every human language. Academic publishing is an ideal
use, especially if you use software to publish PDF documents or
include text in non-European languages.

Kurinto fonts address many publishing pitfalls: costly fonts with
publishing restrictions, irregular line heights, random font changes,
enormous PDF file sizes, missing characters,
spurious layout changes, and font format incompatibility.
These roadblocks prevent many authors from creating presentable (or
even usable) PDF files.

The font is very large, 3.1 Gb.
