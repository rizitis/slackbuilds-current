# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

earlyoom: earlyoom (The Early OOM Daemon)
earlyoom:
earlyoom: earlyoom checks the amount of available memory and free swap up to
earlyoom: 10 times a second (less often if there is a lot of free memory). By
earlyoom: default if both are below 10%, it will kill the largest process
earlyoom: (highest oom_score). The percentage value is configurable via
earlyoom: command line arguments.
