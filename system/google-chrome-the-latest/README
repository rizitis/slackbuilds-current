Installing *and* Maintaining an updated chrome browser on Slackware
is now made easier with this small program, "google-chrome-the-latest".
It is a simple python script that checks what is the latest
version available and updates it on your Slackware box directly
from Google.

It does this by parsing the web-page at
https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/the-latest-version/chrome
and comparing with the chrome version currently installed.

Chrome is downloaded directly from Google and converted to txz
using the standard rpm2txz command.

You can run this script manually or automatically with the
provided cron.hourly script.
This cron script will attempt to identify which user to notify,
otherwise you can force the variable to USERNAME=’your username’

In order to avoid excessive hits on whatismybrowser.com actual
checks are limited to "once a day", but you can bypass this with the
arguments "install" or "upgrade". These allow the user to force a
download from Google and perforam an install or an upgrade,
if one is required.
Normally it is asked if you want to install the new version, but
providing the argument "silent" will just update with no
human intervention.

Examples:
If you don't have yet Chrome installed you can do so by
simply by running:
/opt/google-chrome-the-latest/google-chrome-the-latest.py install

At any time you can force a download from Google site and upgrade
without any pop-up window with:
/opt/google-chrome-the-latest/google-chrome-the-latest.py silent upgrade

This package installs to /opt/google-chrome-the-latest
