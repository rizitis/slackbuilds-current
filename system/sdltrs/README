sdltrs (Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P Emulator)

sdltrs is a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P emulator for Macintosh
OSX, Windows and Linux. It has been ported from the excellent X
Window Unix emulator xtrs. Instead of using the X-Window system for
graphics, it uses the portable SDL library.

Note: When you start up sdltrs for the first time, it attempts to boot
from floppy disk. If you didn't give "-disk0 /path/to/image.dsk"
on the command line (or if you launched it from your desktop's
application menu), it will "hang" with a black screen. Press Alt+D to
enter the emulator's disk menu and either select a bootable floppy
image or disable the floppy disk controller, or else run sdltrs
with the -nofloppy option. See the man page and the documentation at
/usr/doc/sdltrs-1.2.27/html/index.html for further details.
