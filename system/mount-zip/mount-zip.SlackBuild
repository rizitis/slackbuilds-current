# 20230828 bkw: take over maintenance, update for v1.0.9.

# - add CONTRIBUTING.md to the doc dir.
# - add patch to allow v1.0.9 to build on Slackware 15.0.
# - trim down README and slack-desc a bit.

# 20230829 bkw: Stop mount-zip from requiring a version of libzip
# greater than 1.8.0. Long explanation:

# mount-zip calls zip_file_is_seekable() to decide whether it should
# bother to cache the zip file it's working with. This call was added
# to libzip in its version 1.9.0, and Slackware 15.0 only has 1.8.0.

# It turns out, zip_file_is_seekable() only returns true for zip
# files that are not compressed (and not encrypted). This means that
# "stored" zip files are the only ones that don't get cached. This
# patch causes all zip files to get cached. It won't have much impact
# because non-compressed zip files are pretty rare anyway.

# This patch should go away when Slackware 15.1 get released.
