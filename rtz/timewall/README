1.
After installation finish if you intend to use sun position based wallpapers, you need to provide timewall with your approximate location.
as user AND root create:

mkdir -p ~/.config/timewall/
touch ~/.config/timewall/config.toml

And in toml file add yours:
 
[location]
lat = 51.11 # replace it with yours
lon = 17.02 # replace it with yours

To set the wallpaper just run as user:
timewall set path/to/wallpaper.heif

NOTE: We also want /root/.config/timewall/config.toml to be there.
because we start timewall from rc.local...sometimes

command for daemon start manually :
timewall set --daemon

or for start it on boot time: 
cp  rc.timewall /etc/rc.d/rc.timewall
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.timewall

# Add this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.timewall ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.timewall start
fi

# Add this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.timewall ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.timewall stop
fi

To preview the wallpaper, run:

timewall preview path/to/wallpaper.heif
